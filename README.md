## What Is MemClaw?

[MemClaw](https://memclaw.net) is a governed shared memory platform built for AI agent fleets. It's not a vector database bolted onto your pipeline; it's a memory layer designed from the ground up for multi-agent coordination.

> **New to MCP?** MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open standard that lets LLMs call external tools via a consistent interface. MemClaw exposes its memory operations as MCP tools, so any MCP-compatible agent or IDE (Claude Code, Cursor, OpenClaw) can read and write fleet memory without custom integration code. [Learn more →](https://modelcontextprotocol.io)

### Core Features

| Feature | What it means in practice |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Hybrid recall** | Vector similarity + keyword match + knowledge graph traversal in one call. Agents find relevant memories even when they paraphrase the original query. |
| **Fleet namespacing** | Every memory is scoped to a `fleet_id`. Multiple fleets share one tenant without bleeding into each other. |
| **Row-level security** | `scope_agent` flag makes a memory readable only by the writing agent. Per-row ACL enforced at the storage layer. |
| **Contradiction detection** | `memclaw_insights` scans the fleet for conflicting rules across stored memories and surfaces them post-commit for agent review. |
| **Audit trail** | Writes and deletes are audit-logged on OSS; per-recall logging and dashboard querying are Prism-managed features. |
| **PII detection** | Sensitive content is auto-detected and stamped with a PII flag; use `scope_agent=true` to restrict access to the writing agent. |
| **Prism dashboard** | Live view of all fleet memories, memory types, and agent activity at [memclaw.net/prism](https://memclaw.net/prism). |
| **Knowledge graph** | Entities and relationships extracted from memories, queryable as a graph via `memclaw_entity_get`. |

### MCP Tools Used in This Pipeline

This repo connects to the MemClaw MCP server over Streamable HTTP. `pipeline/mcp_client.py` initializes an MCP session, calls `tools/list` to get live schemas, and executes model-selected tools with `tools/call`. A REST compatibility mode is available for tests and debugging by setting `MEMCLAW_TRANSPORT=rest`.

| Tool | MCP method | What it does |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `memclaw_write` | `tools/call` | Persist a decision, rule, fact, or insight |
| `memclaw_recall` | `tools/call` | Hybrid semantic + keyword search across fleet memories |
| `memclaw_insights` | `tools/call` | Contradiction detection and pattern analysis |
| `memclaw_list` | `tools/call` | List memories filtered by agent, type, or cursor |
| `memclaw_stats` | `tools/call` | Aggregate counts by memory type, agent, and status |
| `memclaw_entity_get` | `tools/call` | Query the knowledge graph for extracted entities |
| `memclaw_keystones` | `tools/call` | Read mandatory governance rules (policy, not knowledge graph) |

## Why Multi-Agent?

Single agents hit a wall when complexity grows. They lose context, contradict their earlier decisions, and have no way to enforce rules across a long task.

**Multi-agent pipelines solve this by dividing work across specialists.** But they introduce a new problem: agents that can't see each other's decisions make contradictory choices. Agent A bans external JavaScript. Agent B loads a schema library from a CDN. Nobody catches it.

**MemClaw fixes this with shared fleet memory.** Every agent writes its decisions before finishing. Every downstream agent recalls those decisions before acting. Constraints propagate automatically not because the code hard-wires them, but because agents read each other's memory.

This repo demonstrates that pattern end-to-end:

| What's proven | How |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Constraint propagation** | Performance writes "zero external JS" → SEO recalls it → chooses inline JSON-LD |
| **Cross-agent citation** | Code Review cites Performance + SEO memory IDs in its LGTM verdict |
| **Data isolation** | Manager agent has no `write` access; confirms zero writes every run |
| **Hybrid recall** | Vector + keyword + knowledge graph; agents find relevant memories even with paraphrased queries |

## MCP Tool Access Per Agent

Each agent receives an explicit allowlist of MCP tools. Agents cannot call tools outside their allowlist; this enforces least-privilege and makes the data flow auditable.

| Agent | Role | `write` | `recall` | `insights` | `list` | `stats` | `keystones` | `entity_get` |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Frontend** | First in chain; nothing to recall yet. Architects the page and writes all structural decisions. | ✓ |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| **Performance** | Recalls frontend decisions, audits Core Web Vitals, writes bundle and image rules. | ✓ | ✓ |  |  |  |  |  |
| **SEO** | Recalls all fleet memories so schema choices respect Performance's bundle constraints. | ✓ | ✓ |  |  |  |  |  |
| **Code Review** | Recalls full fleet, runs contradiction detection, issues LGTM/BLOCK with cited memory IDs. | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |  |  |  |  |
| **Manager** | Read-only audit across the configured fleet. Proves data isolation; no writes allowed. |  | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

> **Why restrict tools?** Giving every agent every tool is a common mistake. The Manager agent's inability to call `memclaw_write` is enforced at the tool-schema level; it simply never receives that tool definition. At the end of every run it reports zero write operations, which is the read-only isolation proof.

> **What the Manager actually audits:** Before the Manager's `run()` is called, the orchestrator writes two lightweight bootstrap seed memories under the Manager's agent ID to register its identity in MemClaw (required for trust elevation). Those 2 writes happen in the orchestrator pre-flight; the Manager's own audit phase makes zero writes. When you see `memclaw_stats` return `total: 2`, that reflects those seeds scoped to the Manager agent, not the full fleet. The full fleet memory list comes from `memclaw_list`, which enumerates all memories across all agents in the fleet.

> **`memclaw_insights` and `memclaw_stats` scope note:** At default trust level, both `memclaw_insights` and `memclaw_stats` operate on the calling agent's own memories only. This means `memclaw_stats` will return a count scoped to the Manager agent (the 2 bootstrap seeds), not the full fleet; don't be surprised if you see `total: 2` rather than the ~20+ memories the other agents wrote. The complete fleet memory list comes from `memclaw_list`, which does enumerate all agents. Cross-agent contradiction detection works because Code Review first recalls all fleet memories and the model reasons over them directly; `insights` adds automated pattern/staleness analysis on top. For full cross-agent `insights` and `stats`, elevated trust is required; available on managed MemClaw accounts.

## Memory Isolation Layers

MemClaw provides three levels of isolation that can be combined. This pipeline uses fleet-level namespacing as the default.

| Layer                    | Granularity | How it works                                                                                                                                                    | Example value                           | This repo               |
| ------------------------ | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Tenant**               | Coarsest    | Hard structural boundary enforced at the storage layer via row-level security + API key binding. Tenants cannot see each other's data under any circumstances.  | `MEMCLAW_TENANT_ID=acme-corp`           | One tenant per team     |
| **`fleet_id` namespace** | Mid-level   | Every memory is tagged with a `fleet_id`. Reads and writes are scoped to that tag; multiple fleets coexist inside one tenant without bleeding into each other. | `MEMCLAW_FLEET_ID=payments-audit-fleet` | **Default used here** |
| **`scope_agent`**        | Finest      | Per-row server-side ACL flag. When set, only the agent that wrote the memory can recall it. Other agents in the same fleet are blocked.                         | `scope_agent=true` in `memclaw_write`   | Not set in this repo    |

**Recommended defaults:**

- One tenant per organisation or compliance boundary
- One `fleet_id` per pipeline run or project
- Use `scope_agent` only for sensitive per-agent secrets (API keys, PII) that should not be shared downstream

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or later
- A free [MemClaw account](https://memclaw.net). Sign up and get your `MEMCLAW_API_KEY` and `MEMCLAW_TENANT_ID` from the [Prism dashboard](https://memclaw.net/prism). The tenant ID is shown on your dashboard home page immediately after sign-up.
- An LLM that supports OpenAI-compatible function calling. Two options are covered below.

---

### Option A: Managed Cloud LLM

Any provider that exposes an OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` endpoint with function calling support will work.

> **Model requirement:** The model must support `tool_choice` / function calling. If you see zero tool calls in the output, the model does not support it; switch models.

#### 1. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/caura-ai/memclaw-build-fleet.git
cd memclaw-build-fleet

python -m venv .venv

# Windows
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r pipeline/requirements.txt
```

#### 2. Configure `.env`

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # macOS / Linux
copy .env.example .env # Windows
```

Edit `.env`:

```env
LLM_GATEWAY_API_KEY=your_provider_api_key
LLM_GATEWAY_API_URL=https://your-provider-base-url/v1
LLM_GATEWAY_MODEL=your-model-name

MEMCLAW_API_URL=https://memclaw.net
MEMCLAW_MCP_URL=https://memclaw.net/mcp
MEMCLAW_TRANSPORT=mcp
MEMCLAW_API_KEY=mc_your_key_here
MEMCLAW_TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id
MEMCLAW_FLEET_ID=memclaw-build-fleet
```

#### 3. Elevate agent trust (one-time, required)

The Manager and Code Review agents need `trust_level=2` to call `memclaw_stats`, `memclaw_list`, and `memclaw_insights`. Run these two commands once per tenant; they persist and never need repeating:

```bash
curl -X PATCH "https://memclaw.net/api/agents/manager-tenant/trust?tenant_id=YOUR_TENANT_ID" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $MEMCLAW_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"trust_level": 2}'

curl -X PATCH "https://memclaw.net/api/agents/code-review-agent/trust?tenant_id=YOUR_TENANT_ID" \
  -H "X-API-Key: $MEMCLAW_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"trust_level": 2}'
```

> If you skip this step the Manager and Code Review agents will receive 403 errors and the pipeline will report `Data Isolation: ⚠️ UNCONFIRMED`. See the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) table for details.

> **Tenant ID format note:** MemClaw silently normalizes underscores to hyphens in agent IDs and tenant IDs (e.g. `ran_test` → `ran-test`). Paste your tenant ID exactly as shown in the Prism dashboard. If it contains underscores, the PATCH will return 403. Use the hyphenated form if you encounter a 403 on an otherwise correct key.

#### 4. Verify and run

```bash
python pipeline/run_pipeline.py --dry-run
python pipeline/run_pipeline.py
```

---

### Option B: Fully Local with Ollama (no API key required)

Runs entirely on your machine. No cloud provider, no API key.

#### 1. Install Ollama

Download from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com) and install for your OS.

#### 2. Pull a model that supports function calling

```bash
ollama pull llama3.1
```

Other supported models: `mistral-nemo`, `qwen2.5`, `nous-hermes2`. Verify function calling support on the model's Ollama page before using.

#### 3. Clone and install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/caura-ai/memclaw-build-fleet.git
cd memclaw-build-fleet

python -m venv .venv

# Windows
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -r pipeline/requirements.txt
```

#### 4. Configure `.env` for Ollama

```env
LLM_GATEWAY_API_KEY=ollama
LLM_GATEWAY_API_URL=http://localhost:11434/v1
LLM_GATEWAY_MODEL=llama3.1

MEMCLAW_API_URL=https://memclaw.net
MEMCLAW_MCP_URL=https://memclaw.net/mcp
MEMCLAW_TRANSPORT=mcp
MEMCLAW_API_KEY=mc_your_key_here
MEMCLAW_TENANT_ID=your-tenant-id
MEMCLAW_FLEET_ID=memclaw-build-fleet
```

Ollama's OpenAI-compatible server accepts any non-empty string as the API key. `ollama` is the conventional placeholder.

#### 5. Elevate agent trust (one-time, required)

Same as Option A; run the two `curl -X PATCH` commands from [Step 3 above](#3-elevate-agent-trust-one-time-required) before running the pipeline.

#### 6. Start Ollama and run

```bash
# Confirm Ollama is running
ollama list

python pipeline/run_pipeline.py --dry-run
python pipeline/run_pipeline.py
```

---

## Running Options

```bash
# Full pipeline (all 5 agents)
python pipeline/run_pipeline.py

# Skip the Manager audit (faster iteration during development)
python pipeline/run_pipeline.py --skip-manager

# Loop mode: resets memories between runs, pauses for Enter between iterations
python pipeline/run_pipeline.py --loop

# Reset all fleet memories after the run completes
python pipeline/run_pipeline.py --reset

# Save full results to JSON
python pipeline/run_pipeline.py --json-output results.json

# Verbose debug logging (shows every tool call input and output)
python pipeline/run_pipeline.py --log-level DEBUG

# Run a single agent in isolation
python pipeline/agent_frontend.py
python pipeline/agent_performance.py
python pipeline/agent_seo.py
python pipeline/agent_codereview.py
python pipeline/manager.py
```

---

## Expected Output

### `--dry-run`

Use `--dry-run` to verify your environment and MemClaw connectivity before running the full pipeline. It checks that all required env vars are set, opens an MCP session, calls `tools/list`, and exits; no LLM calls, no memories written.

```bash
python pipeline/run_pipeline.py --dry-run
```

![dry-run output](docs/images/output-dry-run.jfif)

If any required env var is missing, the run exits immediately with a clear error before touching the network:

```
ERROR __main__  Missing required env vars: LLM_GATEWAY_API_KEY, LLM_GATEWAY_API_URL, LLM_GATEWAY_MODEL, MEMCLAW_API_KEY, MEMCLAW_TENANT_ID, MEMCLAW_FLEET_ID
Copy .env.example → .env and fill in your keys.
```

### Full pipeline run

**Execution plan**

| # | Agent | MCP Tool Usage |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Frontend Agent | `recall: none  →  write: HTML5/CSS decisions` |
| 2 | Performance Agent | `recall: frontend  →  write: CWV rules` |
| 3 | SEO Agent | `recall: all  →  write: SEO decisions` |
| 4 | Code Review Agent | `recall: all + insights  →  write: verdict` |
| 5 | Manager Tenant | `list + stats + insights  (read-only audit)` |

**Agent Results**

| Agent | Time | Tool Calls |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| ✓ Frontend Agent | 18.4s | `write×3` |
| ✓ Performance Agent | 21.3s | `recall×1  write×3` |
| ✓ SEO Agent | 33.1s | `recall×1  write×2` |
| ✓ Code Review Agent | 34.0s | `recall×3  insights×1  write×1` |
| ✓ Manager Tenant | 40.7s | `stats×1  list×1  insights×2` |

**Verdicts**

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| Code Review Verdict | `✅ LGTM` or `🚫 BLOCK` — depends on model |
| Pipeline Health | `✅ HEALTHY`, `⚠️ WARNINGS`, or `🚫 CRITICAL` — depends on model |
| Data Isolation | `✅ VERIFIED` or `⚠️ UNCONFIRMED` — depends on Manager agent trust level |

```
▸ View memories : https://memclaw.net/prism
```

> **Note on verdict reproducibility:** `Code Review Verdict` and `Pipeline Health` are emitted by the LLM and are model-dependent. Different models (or the same model on different runs) may produce `LGTM` or `BLOCK` depending on how they interpret recalled memories and any detected contradictions. A `BLOCK` verdict is not a pipeline failure; it means the model found a real or apparent inconsistency (e.g. SEO inline JSON-LD read as conflicting with the Performance "no external JS" rule). Review the agent's `final_text` for its cited reasoning.

### Viewing memories in Prism

![Prism output](docs/images/memclaw-prism-output.png)

After any full pipeline run, every memory written by the fleet is visible in the [Prism dashboard](https://memclaw.net/prism). The summary line at the end of the run prints the direct URL:

```
View memories at: https://memclaw.net/prism
```

In Prism you can:

- Browse all memories by fleet, agent, or memory type (`decision`, `rule`, `fact`, `insight`)
- Inspect individual memory content, importance score, tags, and write timestamp
- Filter by agent ID to see exactly what each pipeline agent contributed
- Check the audit log for every write and recall operation across the run

---

## Creating a New Fleet

A "fleet" is a named namespace (`fleet_id`) that scopes all memories written by a group of agents. You don't need to register it anywhere; set the name in `.env` and memories are automatically isolated to that namespace.

### 1. Pick a fleet name

```env
MEMCLAW_FLEET_ID=my-api-review-fleet
```

Any string works. Use something descriptive: `payments-audit-fleet`, `onboarding-pipeline-v2`, `security-review-fleet`.

### 2. Adapt the agent prompts for your domain

Copy `pipeline/agent_seo.py` to `pipeline/agent_<name>.py` and change:

```python
AGENT_ID      = "my-new-agent"
SYSTEM        = "You are a ..."
PROMPT        = "Review the ..."
ALLOWED_TOOLS = ["memclaw_recall", "memclaw_write"]
```

### 3. Register the agent in the orchestrator

In `pipeline/config.py`, add a constant for your agent ID. In `pipeline/run_pipeline.py`, add it to `PIPELINE_STEPS`:

```python
PIPELINE_STEPS = [
    ("Frontend Agent",   agent_frontend,  "recall: none  →  write: HTML5/CSS decisions"),
    ("My New Agent",     agent_myagent,   "recall: all  →  write: my decisions"),   # ← add here
    ...
]
```

### 4. Start with a clean slate

Change `MEMCLAW_FLEET_ID` to a new value to start fresh. Old memories remain under the old namespace and won't affect the new fleet.

```env
MEMCLAW_FLEET_ID=my-api-review-fleet-v2
```

### Fleet isolation at a glance

| Scenario | What to do |
| :--- | :--- |
| New domain, same tenant | Change `MEMCLAW_FLEET_ID` |
| Separate team, full isolation | Create a new MemClaw tenant at [memclaw.net](https://memclaw.net) |
| Agent-level secrets | Set `scope_agent=true` in `memclaw_write` |
| Read-only audit agent | Omit `memclaw_write` from `ALLOWED_TOOLS` (see `manager.py`) |

---

## Querying Fleet Memories

After the pipeline runs, query the written memories three ways.

### Claude Code MCP

Register the MemClaw MCP server with Claude Code:

```bash
claude mcp add \
  --transport http \
  --header "X-API-Key: mc_your_key_here" \
  --scope user \
  memclaw https://memclaw.net/mcp
```

Open a new Claude Code session and ask it to recall memories from your fleet. Claude will call `memclaw_recall` directly against your tenant.

### MCP Inspector

The official MCP debugging tool; browser UI, no code required.

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector
```

Opens at `http://localhost:5173`. Set transport to HTTP, URL to `https://memclaw.net/mcp`, add header `X-API-Key: mc_your_key_here`. Call any tool interactively.

---

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Zero tool calls in output | Model doesn't support function calling | Switch to `llama3.1` or `qwen2.5` (Ollama), or check your provider's capability docs |
| Code Review BLOCK: "No relevant context found" | Earlier agents didn't run, or `MEMCLAW_FLEET_ID` mismatches | Run full pipeline from Agent 1; confirm `MEMCLAW_FLEET_ID` is identical everywhere |
| `ModuleNotFoundError` on a single agent | Running from inside `pipeline/` | Run from repo root: `python pipeline/agent_codereview.py` |
| MemClaw 401 Unauthorized | Missing or malformed API key | Keys follow format `mc_xxxxx`. Get yours at [memclaw.net/prism](https://memclaw.net/prism) |
| LLM gateway 429 rate limit | Provider quota exceeded | Pipeline retries automatically (4 attempts, 20–80s backoff). Set `LLM_GATEWAY_MAX_TOKENS=2048` to reduce per-request size |
| Inline comment breaks `.env` value | Shell comments inside env values | `LLM_GATEWAY_MODEL=my-model` — no trailing `# comments` on the same line |
| Recall returns memories from a different run | `MEMCLAW_FLEET_ID` typo (e.g. `piepline` vs `pipeline`) | Recall queries by tenant first; a typo'd `fleet_id` still returns results but mixes namespaces. Standardise one value in `.env` and keep it consistent across all runs |
| Manager reads return 403 / `Data Isolation: ⚠️ UNCONFIRMED` | Agent `trust_level` is 1; `memclaw_stats`, `memclaw_list`, and `memclaw_insights` require trust ≥ 2 | Elevate trust via the admin API: `curl -X PATCH "https://memclaw.net/api/agents/manager-tenant/trust?tenant_id=<your-tenant-id>" -H "X-API-Key: $MEMCLAW_API_KEY" -d '{"trust_level": 2}'`. Do the same for `code-review-agent`. Only needs to be done once per tenant. |
| `memclaw_insights` returns 403 for Code Review | Agent `trust_level` is 1 | Same fix as above; elevate `code-review-agent` trust to 2 via the admin API |

---

## Using MemClaw with Other Agent Frameworks

This repo is a plain-Python reference implementation; no framework dependency required. The MemClaw MCP server works with any framework that can call an OpenAI-compatible tool or an MCP endpoint.

### CrewAI

Wrap each `memclaw_*` tool as a CrewAI `@tool` and pass it to your `Agent` definition. The `recall_before_acting` and `write_after_deciding` prompts in each agent's `SYSTEM` string map directly onto CrewAI task descriptions.

```python
from crewai_tools import tool
import mcp_client as mcp

@tool("recall fleet memories")
def recall(query: str) -> str:
    """Retrieve relevant memories from the shared fleet before acting."""
    return str(mcp.call_tool("memclaw_recall", {"query": query}, agent_id="my-crew-agent"))

@tool("write fleet memory")
def write(content: str, importance: float = 0.85) -> str:
    """Persist a decision to shared fleet memory after acting."""
    return str(mcp.call_tool("memclaw_write", {"content": content, "importance": importance}, agent_id="my-crew-agent"))
```

Assign `tools=[recall, write]` to agents that need fleet memory. The Manager audit agent gets `tools=[recall]` only; matching the read-only isolation this repo enforces.

### LangGraph / LangChain

Register MemClaw tools as `StructuredTool` objects and bind them to your graph nodes. Each node in the LangGraph state machine corresponds to one agent in this pipeline.

```python
from langchain_core.tools import StructuredTool
import mcp_client as mcp

recall_tool = StructuredTool.from_function(
    func=lambda query: mcp.call_tool("memclaw_recall", {"query": query}, agent_id="langgraph-agent"),
    name="memclaw_recall",
    description="Recall relevant fleet memories before acting.",
)
```

Bind the tool to your `ChatOpenAI` model with `llm.bind_tools([recall_tool, write_tool])`; the rest of the agentic loop (tool-call → execute → feed back) works identically to `agent_base.py`.

### AutoGen / AG2

Add MemClaw tools to an `AssistantAgent`'s function map. AutoGen's `register_for_llm` + `register_for_execution` pattern maps cleanly onto the write-after-deciding pattern:

```python
import autogen, mcp_client as mcp

assistant = autogen.AssistantAgent("seo_agent", llm_config={...})

@assistant.register_for_llm(description="Recall fleet memories.")

### Harness AI / Custom Orchestrators

Any orchestrator that can make HTTP POST requests can call MemClaw directly without this Python client. Set `MEMCLAW_TRANSPORT=rest` in `.env` to use the REST fallback path in `mcp_client.py`, or POST to `https://memclaw.net/api/v1/recall` and `/memories` directly with `X-API-Key` authentication.

The MCP server (`https://memclaw.net/mcp`) also works with any MCP-compatible runtime; register it as an MCP tool server and each tool schema is discovered automatically at session start.

## Contributing

Contributions welcome. Useful directions:

- **New agent types:** accessibility, i18n, analytics, security review, API contract validation
- **Transport coverage:** integration tests with a mock MCP Streamable HTTP server
- **Tests:** unit tests for `mcp_client.py` MCP session handling and REST compatibility mode
- **New pipeline domains:** API design review, infrastructure audit, data pipeline validation

### Development setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/caura-ai/memclaw-build-fleet.git
cd memclaw-build-fleet
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate  # or .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1 on Windows
pip install -r pipeline/requirements.txt
```

Always run `--dry-run` first after making changes:

```bash
python pipeline/run_pipeline.py --dry-run
```

### Adding a new agent

1. Copy `pipeline/agent_seo.py` to `pipeline/agent_<name>.py`
2. Define `AGENT_ID`, `SYSTEM`, `PROMPT`, `ALLOWED_TOOLS`, and a `run() -> dict` function
3. Add the agent ID constant to `config.py`
4. Add the agent to `PIPELINE_STEPS` in `run_pipeline.py`

`agent_base.run_agent()` handles the full tool-use loop, retry logic, and tool execution. You only write prompts and declare which tools the agent can call.
